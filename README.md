Fifa Power Rankings Bot for Sigma United
 

# History
This bot is a bot for use in the Alpha Theta Sigma Chi discord server. It was born on November 21, 2022, for use in recording FIFA power rankings among brothers in the house, but hopefully it grows into having more use. The original developers were Elie Cuevas, Ian Gatlin, Jake Jones, and Nikhil Kakarla. 

# Current Usage
Currently, the bot is configured to take in information about FIFA games played and keep statistics on each brother. 

# Possibilities for Future Usage
There are many functions in the house which could be automated by a bot like this. Some ideas include creating weekly jobs, party jobs, work session jobs, recording Snappa statistics, etc.
